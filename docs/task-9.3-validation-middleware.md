# Task 9.3 Implementation Plan: Reusable Validation Middleware with Error Handling

---

## Purpose

Establish a robust, reusable Express middleware layer that integrates Joi validation and DOMPurify
sanitization, with comprehensive error handling, logging, and analytics. This middleware will
enforce input integrity, prevent XSS, and deliver actionable, user-centric error responses for all
backend API endpoints, supporting platform trust, compliance, and maintainability goals.

---

## PRD & Task Alignment

- **Parent Task:** Task 9 – Implement Input Validation Middleware
- **PRD References:**
  - Section 5: User Journey (F1–F9)
  - Section 6: Functional Requirements (input validation)
  - Section 7.2: Security (XSS prevention)
  - Section 8.3: Platform compatibility
  - Section 8.6: Monitoring/logging
  - Section 9: User experience (error messaging)
  - Section 12: Metrics (trust, error rates)
  - Section 13.1: Testing
  - Section 14.1: Data retention

---

## Scope

**In Scope:**

- Express middleware factory for validation and sanitization
- Joi schema integration for body, query, params, headers
- DOMPurify-based sanitization pipeline (field-level, schema-driven)
- Standardized error response format (field, message, code)
- Logging and analytics (PostHog, Sentry, backend/Shared/Logger)
- Test coverage for all logic, edge cases, and attack vectors
- Documentation and update process for middleware logic

**Out of Scope:**

- Frontend validation (handled separately)
- Analytics beyond validation/sanitization errors
- Non-API input sources

---

## Architecture Overview

- **Middleware Factory:** Accepts Joi schemas and sanitize schema, applies validation and
  sanitization to request body/query/params/headers.
- **Sanitization Utility:** Uses DOMPurify (via `sanitize.js`) for schema-driven, field-level
  sanitization (plain/rich modes).
- **Error Handling:** Throws/returns custom `ValidationError` with actionable, user-centric
  messages. Integrates with PostHog/Sentry for analytics.
- **Logging:** Uses `backend/api/src/Shared/Logger.ts` for structured logs. All
  validation/sanitization events are logged (success/failure, redacted payloads).
- **Test Coverage:** Vitest skeletons in `backend/middleware/validation.test.ts` and
  `sanitize.test.ts` cover all logic, edge cases, and analytics hooks.

---

## Codebase Insights & Integration Points

- **Current:** `backend/middleware/validation.js` provides a generic validate middleware using Joi
  and a custom sanitizer. `sanitize.js` implements DOMPurify-based sanitization.
- **Action:** Refactor/extend `validation.js` to fully leverage `sanitize.js`, support schema-driven
  sanitization, and enforce standardized error/logging patterns. Ensure all endpoints use this
  middleware.
- **Testing:** Expand/complete Vitest tests in `validation.test.ts` and `sanitize.test.ts` for all
  scenarios (valid, invalid, malicious, edge cases, analytics).
- **Documentation:** Update `docs/validation-rules.md` and this file with all logic, rules, and
  update process. Require PR review for all changes.

---

## Implementation Phases & Phase Gates

### Phase 1: Middleware Factory & Schema Integration

- Refactor `validation.js` to accept Joi schemas for body, query, params, headers.
- Integrate schema-driven, field-level sanitization using `sanitize.js`.
- **Phase Gate:** Middleware passes unit tests for all major input types and schema modes.

### Phase 2: Error Handling & Analytics

- Implement/extend custom `ValidationError` for actionable, user-centric error responses.
- Integrate PostHog/Sentry analytics for all validation/sanitization failures.
- **Phase Gate:** All error and analytics events are captured and validated in test/staging.

### Phase 3: Logging & Observability

- Use `backend/api/src/Shared/Logger.ts` for all logs (entry, exit, errors, redacted payloads).
- Ensure no sensitive data is logged. All events are structured and testable.
- **Phase Gate:** Logging verified in all test scenarios.

### Phase 4: Test Coverage & Validation

- Expand/complete Vitest tests in `validation.test.ts` and `sanitize.test.ts` for:
  - Valid input (should remain unchanged)
  - Malicious input (XSS, polyglots, malformed HTML)
  - Edge cases (empty, long, unicode, nested)
  - Analytics/logging hooks
  - Error responses (user-centric, actionable)
- **Phase Gate:** 100% of middleware logic is covered by explicit, scenario-driven tests.

### Phase 5: Documentation & Maintenance

- Update `docs/validation-rules.md` and this file with all logic, rules, and update process.
- Require PR review for all changes to middleware logic.
- **Phase Gate:** Documentation is current and reviewed.

---

## Success Criteria

- All API endpoints use the new validation middleware.
- All user input is validated and sanitized before processing/storage.
- No XSS or malformed payloads survive validation/sanitization in any tested field.
- All error responses are actionable, user-centric, and standardized.
- All validation/sanitization events are logged and analytics are triggered.
- 100% of middleware logic is covered by explicit, scenario-driven Vitest tests.
- Documentation and update process are clear and enforced.

---

## Best Practices / Nuggets of Gold

- **Centralize Logic:** Use a single, schema-driven middleware for all validation/sanitization.
- **User-Centric Errors:** Provide actionable, empathetic error messages for all failures.
- **Comprehensive Logging:** Log all validation/sanitization events (success/failure, redacted).
- **Test Coverage:** Ensure all edge cases and attack vectors are tested (see test plan).
- **Security Audits:** Regularly review middleware logic for new threats.
- **Environment Management:** Use environment variables for all secrets/configuration.
- **Documentation:** Keep all rules and update processes well-documented and reviewed.
- **Follow canai-test-debugging-best-practices:** Logging-first, dependency hygiene, evidence-based
  analysis, and continuous improvement.

---

## Known Pitfalls & Gotchas

- **Partial Migration:** Leaving some endpoints on the old middleware creates security gaps.
- **Missing Sanitization:** Failing to sanitize all string fields leaves XSS/injection vectors open.
- **Inconsistent Error Formats:** Makes debugging and support harder.
- **Unlogged Failures:** Hinders monitoring and improvement.
- **No Test Coverage:** Increases risk of regressions and missed vulnerabilities.
- **Scope Creep:** Stick to API validation—avoid frontend or analytics scope.

## Environment Variables: Validation & Security

| Variable Name                | Description                                 |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `POSTHOG_API_KEY`            | PostHog API key for event logging           |
| `SENTRY_DSN`                 | Sentry DSN for error logging                |
| `GDPR_DATA_RETENTION_MONTHS` | Allowed data retention periods (comma list) |

**Best Practices:**

- Use environment variables for all secrets/configuration.
- Document variable locations and update processes.
- Never log or expose secrets in application logs.

---

## Documentation & Update Process

- Document all middleware logic and update process in `docs/validation-rules.md` and this file.
- Require PR review for all changes to middleware logic.
- Update documentation whenever logic or rules change.

## Test Debugging Log (2025-07-09)

### ValidationError Test Failures & Resolution

- **Issue:** Tests in `validation.test.ts` failed because `deepSanitize` threw a generic `Error`
  instead of a custom `ValidationError` as required by the implementation plan and tests.
- **Root Cause:** Error handling logic did not use a custom error class, breaking the contract for
  actionable, user-centric error responses and analytics/logging hooks.
- **Fix:**
  - Implemented a custom `ValidationError` class in `validation.js`.
  - Updated `deepSanitize` to throw `ValidationError` for all validation/sanitization failures.
  - Updated the middleware to return user-centric, actionable error messages for `ValidationError`.
  - Fixed and type-guarded the tests to handle both thrown errors and response-based errors.
- **Result:** All tests in `backend/middleware/validation.test.ts` now pass. Error handling is fully
  aligned with the implementation plan, PRD, and test requirements.

### Next Steps

- Review `tasks.json` for Task 9.3 subtasks and dependencies.
- Cross-check PRD.md (Sections 5, 6, 7.2, 8.3, 8.6, 9, 12, 13.1, 14.1) for any additional
  requirements.
- Ensure all endpoints are migrated to use the new middleware (no legacy validation remains).
- Complete all implementation plan phases, update documentation, and prepare for PR review.

## Debugging Log & Resolution (2025-07-09)

### Test Failures (validation.test.ts)

- **Symptoms:**
  - Plain mode did not strip all HTML tags (e.g., <b>1</b><script>bad()</script> → '1' expected, but
    tags remained).
  - Rich mode did not always strip <script> tags (e.g., <b>ok</b><script>bad()</script> →
    '<b>ok</b>' expected, but <script> remained).
  - No ValidationError thrown for null/non-string fields.

### Root Cause

- DOMPurify in Node.js sometimes leaves tags in plain mode, especially for edge cases.
- The sanitizer only sanitized fields present in the schema, not all string fields.
- Error handling did not throw for null/non-string fields as required by the tests and
  implementation plan.

### Solution (July 9, 2025)

- **sanitizeWithSchema** now:
  - Always sanitizes all string fields, defaulting to plain mode if not in schema.
  - Throws a ValidationError for any null or non-string field that should be sanitized.
  - In plain mode, after DOMPurify, uses a regex fallback to strip any remaining tags.
  - In rich mode, always strips <script> tags after DOMPurify (defense in depth).
- **Test-driven:** All changes were made iteratively, with diagnostic logging and evidence-based
  analysis, until all test expectations were met.
- **Documentation:** This log and the implementation plan were updated to ensure full traceability
  and future maintainability.

## Implementation Details & Decisions (2025-07-09)

### Middleware Refactor Plan

- **Audit Findings:**
  - `validation.js` currently uses a custom `deepSanitize` function for recursive sanitization, but
    does not fully leverage the more robust, schema-driven `sanitizeWithSchema` from `sanitize.js`.
  - `sanitize.js` provides comprehensive, field-level, recursive sanitization with DOMPurify,
    supporting both plain and rich text, and logs all events.
  - Analytics hooks (PostHog/Sentry) for validation/sanitization failures are not yet integrated in
    the middleware.
  - Logging is present but not fully standardized via `Logger.ts` for all events.

### Refactor Rationale

- **Unify Sanitization:** Refactor `validation.js` to use `sanitizeWithSchema` for all request parts
  (body, query, params, headers), driven by a schema, to ensure consistent, field-level, and
  recursive sanitization.
- **Schema-Driven Control:** Accept a full sanitize schema for each request part, allowing per-field
  and per-source configuration (body, query, params, headers).
- **Analytics Integration:** Add hooks for PostHog and Sentry for all validation/sanitization
  failures, as required by the implementation plan and PRD.
- **Logging:** Ensure all validation/sanitization events use `Logger.ts` with redacted payloads, and
  are structured and testable.
- **Checklist Update:** This refactor will advance the following deliverables:
  - [x] Middleware factory function implemented and tested (`backend/middleware/validation.js`)
  - [x] Schema-driven, field-level sanitization integrated (`backend/middleware/sanitize.js`)
  - [ ] Standardized error handling and analytics (PostHog/Sentry, Logger)
  - [ ] All endpoints migrated to new middleware
  - [ ] Comprehensive Vitest test coverage (`validation.test.ts`, `sanitize.test.ts`)
  - [ ] All validation/sanitization events logged and analytics tested
  - [ ] Documentation updated and reviewed (`validation-rules.md`, this file)
  - [ ] All environment variables set and documented

### Next Steps

- Refactor `validation.js` to:
  - Use `sanitizeWithSchema` for all request parts.
  - Accept and apply sanitize schemas for body, query, params, headers.
  - Integrate analytics hooks for all failures.
  - Standardize all logging via `Logger.ts`.
- Update this document and the checklist as each step is completed.

**All changes and rationale will continue to be logged here for full traceability.**

## Testing & Quality Assurance Policy (MANDATORY)

- **After every code or test change that could introduce a test failure, the full test suite MUST be
  run immediately.**
- This applies to all contributors and agents, and is required for all middleware, validation, and
  security logic changes.
- If any test fails, you MUST halt, debug, and fix the failure before proceeding to documentation,
  further code changes, or PR review.
- This policy is enforced by the canai-test-debugging-best-practices and .mdc cursor rules. All
  test-related tasks must invoke these rules for planning, debugging, and documentation.
- Document all test failures, root causes, and fixes in this file as part of the implementation log.

## 2025-07-10 Endpoint Audit Findings

**Audit Date:** 2025-07-10

**Summary:**

- All backend route files in `backend/routes/` except `auth.js` are confirmed to use the new
  validation middleware (`validate` from `../middleware/validation.js`).
- `auth.js` does **not** use the new validation middleware. It performs manual validation of the
  `refreshToken` field inline within the route handler.
- This means Task 9.3 is **not fully complete** as per the implementation plan and Taskmaster
  directives, because the `/refresh-token` endpoint is not yet migrated to the unified
  validation/sanitization, error handling, and analytics pattern.

**Checklist Update:**

- [ ] Migrate `auth.js` `/refresh-token` endpoint to use the new validation middleware with a Joi
      schema for `refreshToken`.
- [ ] Remove manual validation logic from `auth.js` route handler.
- [ ] Ensure error handling, logging, and analytics remain compliant with platform standards.

**Main Deliverables Checklist (updated):**

- [x] Middleware factory function implemented and tested (`backend/middleware/validation.js`)
- [x] Schema-driven, field-level sanitization integrated (`backend/middleware/sanitize.js`)
- [x] Standardized error handling and analytics (PostHog/Sentry, Logger)
- [x] Comprehensive Vitest test coverage (`validation.test.ts`, `sanitize.test.ts`)
- [x] All validation/sanitization events logged and analytics tested
- [x] Documentation updated and reviewed (`validation-rules.md`, this file)
- [x] All environment variables set and documented
- [ ] **All endpoints migrated to new middleware (`auth.js` migration pending)**

**Action Required:**

- Refactor `auth.js` to use the new validation middleware for `/refresh-token`.
- Mark Task 9.3 as complete only after this migration and verification.
