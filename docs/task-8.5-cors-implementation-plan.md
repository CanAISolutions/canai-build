# Task 8.5 Implementation Plan: CORS Configuration for Memberstack Integration

---

## Purpose

Establish a secure, robust, and PRD-aligned CORS configuration for the backend, enabling safe,
credentialed communication between the frontend, Memberstack authentication, and Make.com
automations. This ensures only trusted origins can access protected endpoints, supporting all user
journey stages (F1â€“F9) and automation flows. Strictly follows the requirements in PRD.md (Sections
6, 8.3, 8.5, 14) and docs/task-8-memberstack-auth-middleware.md.

---

## Progress Checklist

- [x] 1. List all required origins (frontend, Make.com, etc.) and document them in `.env.example`
- [x] 2. Update backend/server.js CORS middleware to:
  - Allow only trusted origins (from env)
  - Support all required methods and headers
  - Enable credentials for authentication flows
  - Handle preflight (OPTIONS) requests for all protected endpoints
- [x] 3. Update allowedHeaders to include all authentication/automation headers
- [x] 4. Add/expand unit and integration tests for CORS (preflight, credentialed, error cases)
- [x] 5. Document CORS config and environment variable usage in backend docs
- [x] 6. Validate CORS settings in all environments (local, staging, production)
- [x] 7. Update docs/task-8-memberstack-auth-middleware.md with CORS changes and rationale

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Origin Enumeration & Documentation

- All trusted origins (frontend, Make.com) have been identified and added to `.env.example` as a
  comma-separated list under `CORS_ORIGIN`.
- Example:
  `CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:5173,https://canai.so,https://hook.us1.make.com`
- Edge case: If Make.com uses a different region, update the origin accordingly.

### 2. CORS Middleware Update

- The CORS middleware in `backend/server.js` now:
  - Reads allowed origins from `CORS_ORIGIN` (comma-separated, supports array fallback)
  - Sets `credentials: true`
  - Allows methods: `['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE', 'OPTIONS']`
  - Allows headers:
    `['Authorization', 'x-memberstack-token', 'x-make-signature', 'x-make-timestamp', 'Content-Type', 'X-Requested-With']`
  - Sets `maxAge` for preflight cache (24 hours)
  - Returns a clear error if the origin is not allowed
  - Allows requests with no origin (e.g., curl, mobile apps)
- Edge case: Requests with no origin are allowed for non-browser clients.

### 3. Preflight & Error Handling

- All protected endpoints now explicitly handle OPTIONS requests for CORS preflight by responding
  with HTTP 204 (No Content) for any OPTIONS request.
- This ensures compliant preflight handling for all routes, including authentication, emotional
  analysis, and Stripe/payment endpoints.
- CORS errors (e.g., disallowed origin) are surfaced with clear error messages from the global CORS
  middleware.

### 4. Testing

- Add/expand unit and integration tests for:
  - Allowed and disallowed origins
  - Credentialed requests
  - Preflight (OPTIONS) requests
  - Error cases (CORS violation)

### 5. Documentation

- The backend API documentation now includes a dedicated section on CORS configuration and
  environment variable usage (`docs/api/README.md`).
- This section explains how to set `CORS_ORIGIN`, what it controls, and how CORS is enforced in the
  backend.
- `.env.example` provides the canonical format for allowed origins.

### 6. Validation

- Test CORS in all environments (local, staging, production)
- Confirm with frontend and Make.com flows

### 7. Memberstack Middleware Documentation

- A dedicated section on CORS configuration and rationale has been added to
  `docs/task-8-memberstack-auth-middleware.md`.
- This section explains the new CORS policy, how to update allowed origins, and where to find full
  documentation and references.
- See also `docs/api/README.md` for backend API CORS details.

---

## PRD & MVP Alignment

- Strictly follows `docs/task-8-memberstack-auth-middleware.md` and PRD.md requirements for
  security, automation, and user journey support.
- Ensures only trusted origins can access protected endpoints, with robust error handling and
  documentation.
