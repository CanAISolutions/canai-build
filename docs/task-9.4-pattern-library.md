# Task 9.4 Implementation Plan: Pattern Library for Business Field Validation

---

## Purpose

Establish a robust, reusable pattern library for business field validation, including regex patterns
and helper functions for business type categories, enhanced email validation, phone numbers, postal
codes, URLs, and social media handles. This library will support consistent, secure, and
maintainable validation across all backend API endpoints, aligning with platform trust, compliance,
and maintainability goals.

## PRD & Task Alignment

- **Parent Task:** Task 9 – Implement Input Validation Middleware
- **PRD References:**
  - Section 5: User Journey (F1–F9)
  - Section 6: Functional Requirements (input validation)
  - Section 7.2: Security (input integrity)
  - Section 8.3: Platform compatibility
  - Section 8.6: Monitoring/logging
  - Section 9: User experience (error messaging)
  - Section 12: Metrics (trust, error rates)
  - Section 13.1: Testing
  - Section 14.1: Data retention

---

## Scope

**In Scope:**

- Regex patterns for business categories, email, phone, postal code, URL, and social handles
- Pattern constants file and validation helper functions
- Documentation and update process for all patterns
- Test coverage for all patterns and edge cases

**Out of Scope:**

- Frontend validation (handled separately)
- Analytics beyond validation errors
- Non-API input sources

---

## Architecture Overview

- **Pattern Constants File:** Centralized file exporting all regex patterns for reuse.
- **Validation Helpers:** Functions to apply patterns and return standardized error
  objects/messages.
- **Integration Points:** Used by Joi schemas, middleware, and any backend validation logic.
- **Test Coverage:** Vitest skeletons for all patterns and helpers, covering valid, invalid, and
  edge cases.
- **Documentation:** This file and code comments document all patterns, usage, and update process.

---

## Implementation Phases & Phase Gates

### Phase 1: Pattern Definition & Constants

- Define regex patterns for each field (business type, email, phone, postal code, URL, social
  handle).
- Export all patterns from a single constants file.
- **Phase Gate:** All patterns are defined, documented, and pass initial test cases.

### Phase 2: Validation Helpers

- Implement helper functions to apply patterns and return standardized error objects/messages.
- Integrate with Joi schemas and middleware as needed.
- **Phase Gate:** Helpers are tested and integrated with at least one schema.

### Phase 3: Test Coverage & Validation

- Write Vitest tests for all patterns and helpers:
  - Valid input (should pass)
  - Invalid input (should fail)
  - Edge cases (unicode, long, malformed, etc.)
- **Phase Gate:** 100% of patterns and helpers are covered by explicit, scenario-driven tests.

### Phase 4: Documentation & Maintenance

- Update this file with all patterns, test cases, and update process.
- Require PR review for all changes to patterns or helpers.
- **Phase Gate:** Documentation is current and reviewed.

---

## Success Criteria

- All business field validations use the new pattern library.
- All patterns are robust, well-documented, and reusable.
- All error responses are actionable, user-centric, and standardized.
- 100% of patterns and helpers are covered by explicit, scenario-driven Vitest tests.
- Documentation and update process are clear and enforced.

## Best Practices / Nuggets of Gold

- **Centralize Patterns:** Use a single constants file for all regex patterns.
- **User-Centric Errors:** Provide actionable, empathetic error messages for all validation
  failures.
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Ensure all edge cases and attack vectors are tested (see test plan).
- **Security Audits:** Regularly review patterns for new threats and false positives/negatives.
- **Documentation:** Keep all patterns and update processes well-documented and reviewed.
- **Follow canai-test-debugging-best-practices:** Logging-first, dependency hygiene, evidence-based
  analysis, and continuous improvement.

---

## Known Pitfalls & Gotchas

- **Overly Permissive Patterns:** Allowing invalid data through due to weak regex.
- **Overly Restrictive Patterns:** Blocking valid edge cases (e.g., international phone numbers,
  rare email formats).
- **Unlogged Failures:** Hinders monitoring and improvement.
- **No Test Coverage:** Increases risk of regressions and missed vulnerabilities.
- **Scope Creep:** Stick to backend/API validation—avoid frontend or analytics scope.

## Next Steps Before Code Change

1. List all field types and their validation requirements (see above).
2. Draft regex patterns and helper functions.
3. Plan for error format and logging consistency.
4. Prepare to run the full test suite and analyze failures.
5. Document all findings and update best practices as needed.
