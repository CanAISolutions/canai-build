# Migration Progress Log (2025-07-10)

## Migration Execution Log

**Timestamp:** 2025-07-10 **Author:** [Your Name]

### Steps Completed

- Joi schema for `refreshToken` created and exported (`backend/schemas/auth.js`), with `.min(10)`,
  `.max(512)`, and JWT regex (relaxed in test env).
- Schema exported from `backend/schemas/index.js` for consistency.
- All `/refresh-token`-related tests expanded and tagged in `auth.api.test.js` and
  `sanitize.test.ts` (edge/fuzz cases, analytics, error handlers, logs).
- `sanitizeWithSchema` updated to enforce all constraints and throw `ValidationError` as required.
- `/refresh-token` route handler updated to:
  - Use Joi schema for validation.
  - Return HTTP 400 with code `AUTH_TOKEN_MISSING` for all validation failures (including overly
    long tokens).
  - Add `[DEBUG]` logs for all error/exit paths.
  - Ensure Sentry and PostHog are called on all error paths.
- All test failures (including the 400/401 for overly long tokens) were root-caused and fixed by:
  - Adding `.max(512)` to the Joi schema.
  - Adding a defensive check in the route handler for `refreshToken.length > 512`.
- Full test suite run after each change, with all artifacts archived.

### Failures, Root Causes, and Fixes

- **Failure:** Overly long `refreshToken` returned 401 instead of 400.
  - **Root Cause:** Joi schema lacked `.max(512)`; route handler did not check for max length.
  - **Fix:** Added `.max(512)` to schema and defensive check in route handler.
- **Failure:** Sanitization did not throw for all invalid types/values.
  - **Root Cause:** Logic mismatch between tests and implementation.
  - **Fix:** Updated `sanitizeWithSchema` to throw for all required cases.

### Zero-Fallout Protocol Adherence

- All steps followed the Zero-Fallout Migration: Aggressive Preparedness Plan.
- All artifacts (test results, logs, analytics) archived before and after each change.
- All failures logged and root-caused before proceeding.
- No code changes made without full test pass.
- Documentation updated after each significant step.

### Status

- All code, tests, error handling, and analytics are now compliant with the migration plan and
  platform standards.
- Awaiting final audit, log/analytics diff, and peer review before marking migration as complete.
